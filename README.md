# Laptop_Price_Analysis
This is a machine learning project that predicts laptop prices using regression techniques. The project includes heavy data preprocessing, manipulation, and feature engineering. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) was also conducted to gain insights into the data. After testing both machine learning and deep learning algorithms, we decided to use the Random Forest algorithm as our final model.


# Dependencies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is 'laptop_data.csv'. It contains information about various laptops such as brand, screen size, processor, RAM, storage, and price. The dataset has 1300 rows and 11 columns. The dataset required extensive data preprocessing, feature engineering, and one-hot encoding.
